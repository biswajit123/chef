Yelp Reviews Ticker is an easy to use widget that allows you to show your business yelp reviews.

== Description ==

This widget will allow you to show a list of up to 3 reviews snippets/excerpts (via Yelp API) for your business in a customizable ticker display that is yelp compliant.

The ticker will show the user profile image, user name, the rating given by the user (1-5 stars), the excerpt of the user review, a link to your business yelp page, the date the review was given and the required yelp logo.

It allows you to easily configure the widget title (if you'd like one), the speed in which the ticker will rotate the reviews, the amount of time each review will be displayed for and the number of reviews it will show at once.

== Installation ==

1. Upload yelprt to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place Yelp Review Ticker Widget in a Widget Area.
4. Set up the display options according to your likings.
5. Add your yelp business url and the Yelp API keys/tokens/secret .
6. Don't forget to rate if you like or dislike it!.

= Notes: =
If you don't already have a Yelp API key it is super easy to get it:

1. Sign up for a Yelp user account at http://www.yelp.com/signup if you don't have one yet.
2. Login, then register for an API key and have instant access.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is it easy to setup? =

Yes, super easy, all you need is a Yelp account, sign-up for a Yelp API key (http://www.yelp.com/developers/getting_started/api_access), and have your business listed on Yelp.

= Where do I find the Key, Token, Secret? =

It's easy, login to your yelp account and go to this link http://www.yelp.com/developers/getting_started/api_access there you will "apply" for the Yelp API access and  give you all the keys you need. The whole process takes about 5 minutes.

= Why do I need my own Yelp API keys? Why can't you just provide me with one? =

This widget works with the Yelp API and each site developer must have their own. If I were to provide you with mine I'd be breaking Yelp's API rules and terms.

= Where do I find my API Business URL?  =

Go to your business yelp page and get it's URL,
It should look like this:
http://www.yelp.com/biz/my-business-page-town
Now just replace the part "http://www.yelp.com/biz/" with "http://api.yelp.com/v2/business/" and it should look like this:
http://api.yelp.com/v2/business/my-business-page-town

= Why can I only display up to 3 reviews? I want to display all of my reviews... =

Sorry that is not up to me. The API and YELP's terms only allow the latest 3 exerpts

= My reviews are not showing in full, It only displays exerpts =

Again Yelp will allow only exerpts not the full review, but don't worry a link to the full review is posted right below it :)
